I am a PhD student in the Department of Zoology at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in the [Conservation Science Group](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/conservation-science) and the [Energy and Environment Group](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/research/eeg). I am  supervised by [Andrew Balmford](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/andrew-balmford), and co-supervised by [Anil Madhavapeddy](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/avsm2) and [Tom Swinfield](https://4c.cst.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-tom-swinfield). I am also part of the [AI for Environmental Risks Centre for Doctoral Training](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/), a researcher at the [Cambridge Centre for Carbon Credits](https://4c.cst.cam.ac.uk/), and a member of [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/). My research focuses on quantifying species-specific responses to anthropogenic threats (like hunting and agriculture) across terrestrial vertebrate species. My training is as a data scientist and, as such, I primarily use methods from machine learning, remote sensing, and optimization.

Previously, I received a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Data Science with a minor in Math from [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) and Master of Research (MRes) in Environmental Data Science from Cambridge.
