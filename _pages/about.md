I am a Master of Research (MRes) student at the University of Cambridge in the [AI for Environmental Risks Centre for Doctoral Training](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/); I will be joining the Department of Zoology at Cambridge for my PhD research. I am also a member of Churchill College. Previously, I recieved a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Data Science with a minor in Math from William & Mary (Virginia, USA). My research interests are primarily in methods for predictive modeling, with an emphasis on machine learning, and their applications to biodiversity conservation.
